# NeuroAlgo

## Plan for the library
The goal is to take all the code from dead libraries that are still usable and put it into this repository so that we know what is happening with them. No GUI here, this is just a repository of the analysis techniques per say to be used at the command line. If making an analysis please look at the Scripts repository.

1) Get the analysis code from EEGsonic and format it into ready to use code.

## To Get
* Chronux
* BCT
* eeglab fork
* EEGsonic code
* EEGapp code
